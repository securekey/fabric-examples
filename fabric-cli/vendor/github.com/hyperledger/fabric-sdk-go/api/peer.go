/**
 * The Peer class represents a peer in the target blockchain network to which
 * HFC sends endorsement proposals, transaction ordering or query requests.
 *
 * The Peer class represents the remote Peer node and its network membership materials,
 * aka the ECert used to verify signatures. Peer membership represents organizations,
 * unlike User membership which represents individuals.
 *
 * When constructed, a Peer instance can be designated as an event source, in which case
 * a “eventSourceUrl” attribute should be configured. This allows the SDK to automatically
 * attach transaction event listeners to the event stream.
 *
 * It should be noted that Peer event streams function at the Peer level and not at the
 * channel and chaincode levels.
